This Flutter project showcases the implementation of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. It effectively manages the state of the application by
handling various events, such as marking a product as a favorite and deleting a product, using BLoC.

The BLoC pattern is a powerful state management technique in Flutter. It separates the presentation layer from the business logic and application state, making your code more
organized and maintainable. With BLoC, you can efficiently handle user interactions and business operations while keeping your UI clean and responsive.
